Contributing to BrynerCoin Core
============================

The BrynerCoin project operates in an ad-hoc, entirely unreliable fashion.
Pull requests shouldn't break the CI, and shouldn't break unit tests (once
unit tests are fixed and actually work).


Contributor Workflow
--------------------

1. Get the code
2. Change the code
3. Test the code
4. Pull request
5. Roll dice


Squashing Commits
---------------------------

Dunno what this is but I should probably learn more about it.


Pull Request Philosophy
-----------------------

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯


### Features

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯


### Refactoring

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯


"Decision Making" Process
-------------------------

If it looks good I'll make a decision.


### Peer Review

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

### Finding Reviewers

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
