What is BrynerCoin?
----------------

BrynerCoin is an immature digital currency based on the Litecoin source code.
Brynercoin allows for instant digital payments to anyone, anywhere in the world,
using peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority. BrynerCoin
Core is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this
currency.

BrynerCoin's value is not directly tied to any fiat currency or other resource;
no matter where you are in the world, 1 BRY will always be worth 1 BRY. This
fundamental principle allows for easy transactions between "the boys." For
example, admission to the Minecraft server costs 50 BRY. Using valueless
blockchain technology allows for large-brained transactions between any two of
"the boys." 

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the BrynerCoin Core software, see
[https://downloads.bryner.tech](https://downloads.bryner.tech).
